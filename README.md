# Simple-Journal
This is a simple GUI application built using tkinter in Python. It allows users to input a date, time, and journal entry, and then retrieves and displays the combined date and time along with the journal entry.

# [Prerequisites](/REQUIREMENTS.txt)
Before running this application, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- tkinter library

# Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```pip install tkinter```

# Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.
 
Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

Run the following command to start the application:
```python main.py```

The application window will appear, prompting you to enter the date, time, and journal entry.

Fill in the respective fields and click the "Submit" button.

If the date and time are in the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD for date and HH:MM:SS for time), the application will display the combined date and time as well as the journal entry in the console.

If the date or time format is incorrect, an error message will be displayed.

You can repeat the process by entering new values and clicking the "Submit" button again.

Close the application window when you're done.

# Notes
Make sure to enter the date and time in the specified formats to avoid errors.

The combined date and time, along with the journal entry, will be printed to the console. You can modify the code to display them in a different way if desired.

Feel free to customize the GUI elements (labels, entry fields, button) according to your preferences.
